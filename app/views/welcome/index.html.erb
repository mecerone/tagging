<h1>Crowdsourcing Chrysosotom</h1>
<p>Posted on December 4, 2013 by <a href="jacobcerone.com">jacobcerone</a></p>

<p>For a long time I have thought it would be a great thing to have the Migne Greek Father and Latin Father series digitized, tagged, and translated. It was brought to my attention that Logos plans on releasing the Greek and Latin copies of Migne. The problem is, none of the volumes are tagged or translated (They have said that tagging may be included at a later date due to interest). While the digitization of Migne is a huge first step, Migne is no more accessible to students than before. After all, anyone can download all the volumes from archive or google books. That’s where crowdsourcing comes in.</p>

<p>Crowdsourcing, I’m sure you are familiar with the concept. If you aren’t, crowdsourcing is the process of appealing to a large audience in order to obtain the money for start up costs or completing large tedious tasks. I would like to initially apply the concept to Chrysostom’s Homilies on Philippians.</p>

<p>Now, I know my vision is fundamentally flawed. Crowdsourcing relies on a large pool of individuals to contribute to the project. For this project, we are limited to people who know Greek, are interested in Chrysostom, and are willing to put a bit more time than is required to “simply translate” the passage. Nevertheless, I’m going to make a go of it!</p>

<p>What I would like is some help morphologically tagging and translating the homilies throughout the year. I have done the first paragraph. You can access the work here. Like the reading plan, everything is tentative at the moment. Mary Beth, my wife, will help build the database and the means of inputing the tagging into the database.</p>

<p>Why put in such a large amount of effort? The work that is produced will make the text more accessible for those interested in translating it. It will give you more practice recognizing forms, parts of speech, etc. Finally, maybe, just maybe, we will convince Logos or Accordance that digitization, tagging, and translating are all goals worth the time and effort!</p>
